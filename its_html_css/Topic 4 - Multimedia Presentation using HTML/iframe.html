<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections, with a link
element pointing to a style sheet.
A fallback message can be provided between the <iframe> </iframe> tags
to be displayed when inline frame support is disabled.
3. Within the body section, insert an article containing a heading and
descriptive paragraph, and with a specified class name for positional
styling purposes.
4. Next, in the body, as an aside, insert an inline frame to load a
document containing relevant text and illustrative photographs positioned
horizontally side-by-side.
Refer to:
    concept.html
Refer to:
    iframe.css
5. Now, create a style sheet to size the article and position it to the
left of the inline frame.
6. Save the HTML document and style sheet then open the web page to see
the article and the inline frame content.
Drag the scrollbar to see the images. Embedding documents within inline
frames is particularly favored on property websites to accompany property
descriptions with photographs in a compact page format.
