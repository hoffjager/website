<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections,
with a link element pointing to a style sheet.
3. Within the body section, insert a heading.
4. Next, insert a captioned figure.
Always refer to figures only by their label - avoid using reference
terms like "in the figure on the right" so the document layout can be
easily changed without creating confusion.
5. Now, insert text content that makes reference to the previous
captioned figure.
6. Insert a second captioned figure.
7. Now, insert text content that makes reference to the second
captioned figure.
Refer to:
    figure.css

        Front-end development, also known as client-
        side development, is the practice of producing HTML
        documents, CSS style sheets, and JavaScript script code
        (Figure 1) for a website or Web Application - so a user can
        see and interact with them directly.

        Back-end development, also known as server-side
        development, is the practice of producing complex
        websites using programming languages such as SQL, Java,
        PHP or .NET (Figure 2) to provide features beyond front-
        end capabilities.
