<!--
1. Start a new HTML5 document that incorporates a script.
2. In the body section, insert elements to embed an audio resource for
manual playback.
Include an id attribute in the <audio> tag to reference the media from
script, and in all other tags that the script needs to reference.
3. Next, insert an image button to control payback.
4. Now, insert elements to present a visual indicator and calculated
percentage as playback proceeds.
5. Begin a script with a function to initialize variables when the HTML
document has loaded.
Refer to:
    progress.js
6. Insert a function to control playback.
The control will play or pause playback according to the Boolean value
of the run variable.
7. Insert a function to display playback progress.
8. Save the HTML document and script file, then open the web page in a
browser and click the button to see playback progress.
The currentTime and duration properties store time in seconds as
floating-point values, so need to be rounded down with Math.floor().
