<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections.
3. Within the body section, insert a container element.
The <source> element does not require a closing tag. It is also used
within the <audio> and <video> elements.
4. Next, insert an image source for display only on devices whose screen
width exceeds 500 pixels.
5. Now, insert an image source for display only on smaller devices whose screen
width exceeds 200 pixels.
6. Finally, insert an image source for display only on older browsers
that do not support the selection feature.
large.png = 205 x 250
medium.png = 103 x 125
small.png = 62 x 75
7. Save the HTML document, then open the web page fullscreen in a
desktop web browser to see the large image.
8. Open the web page on a small device, or re-size the browser window,
to see the small image.
9. Open the page on an old browser to see the medium image.
If you examine the browser cache you should see that it has only
efficiently downloaded the appropriate image to be displayed, not all
images.
