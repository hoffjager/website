<!--
1. Create an HTML5 document containing heading, sub-heading, and paragraph elements.
2. In the head section of the document, immediately after the closing </title> tag, insert a style element block
containing style rule sets for each content element.
3. Save the HTML file then open it in a web browser to see the styles applied to the content elements.
Internal style sheets should only be used where it is desirable to create a
single HTML document for portability – external style sheets, described overleaf,
are always preferable.
Style rules can also be applied internally to individual HTML elements by
assigning "inline" properties and values to the style attribute of that element.
This will override the rules applicable to the same properties of that element
that may have been specified in any other style sheet.
4. Edit the heading elements in the body section to reverse the colors specified
in the style sheet within the document's head section.
5. Save the HTML file again then re-open it in a web browser to see the previous
styles get overridden.
The use of inline style rules should be avoided at all costs – always place
style rules within a style sheet instead.
Although described here for completeness there are drawbacks to using internal
style rules. Multiple individual inline styles are more difficult to maintain
than a single style rule in a style sheet as they would need to be individually
altered to affect a style change to a number of elements. An internal style sheet
is only applicable to the HTML document in which it is contained, whereas an
external style sheet can apply to multiple web pages to consistently style an
entire website from a single file.
