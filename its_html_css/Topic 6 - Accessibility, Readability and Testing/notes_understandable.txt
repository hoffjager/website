Topic 6 - Accessibility, Readability & Testing

Overview
6.1 Construct well-formed HTML and CSS markup that conforms to industry
    best practices: 
        Reusing rules and rule sets, commenting, web-safe fonts,
        cross-platform usability, separation of structure (HTML) and
        style (CSS). 

6.2 Apply accessibility principles and evaluate content accessibility:
        Text alternatives, color contrast and usage, legibility of
        typography, tab order, text resizing, text hierarchy, translate. 

6.3 Evaluate the structural integrity of HTML and CSS markup:
        Syntax errors, tag mismatch, cascading issues.

            Understanding 3.1.5
            Sufficient Techniques
            Note: Other techniques may also be sufficient if they meet the success criterion. See Understanding Techniques.

            Understanding 3.2.1
            Sufficient Techniques
            Note: Other techniques may also be sufficient if they meet the success criterion. See Understanding Techniques.
                G107: Using "activate" rather than "focus" as a trigger for changes of context

                G13: Describing what will happen before a change to a form control that causes a change of context to occur is made
                SCR19: Using an onchange event on a select element without causing a change of context
                Note: A change of content is not always a change of context. This success criterion is automatically met if changes in content are not also changes of context.
            Advisory Techniques
                G201: Giving users advanced warning when opening a new window
            Failures
                F36: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.2 due to automatically submitting a form and given a value
                F37: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.2 due to launching a new window without prior warning when the selection of a radio button, check box or select list is changed
        3.2.3 Consistent Navigation - Level AA
            Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated, unless a change is initiated by the user.
            Understanding 3.2.3
            Sufficient Techniques
            Note: Other techniques may also be sufficient if they meet the success criterion. See Understanding Techniques.
                G61: Presenting repeated components in the same relative order each time they appear
            Advisory Techniques
                PDF14: Providing running headers and footers in PDF documents
                PDF17: Specifying consistent page numbering for PDF documents 
            Failures
                F66: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.3 due to presenting navigation links in a different relative order on different pages
        3.2.4 Consistent Identification - Level AA
            Components that have the same functionality within a set of Web pages are identified consistently.
            Understanding 3.2.4
            Sufficient Techniques
            Note: Other techniques may also be sufficient if they meet the success criterion. See Understanding Techniques.
                G197: Using labels, names, and text alternatives consistently for content that has the same functionality.
                Note 1: Text alternatives that are “consistent” are not always “identical.” For instance, you may have an graphical arrow at the bottom of a Web page that links to the next Web page. The text alternative may say “Go to page 4.” Naturally, it would not be appropriate to repeat this exact text alternative on the next Web page. It would be more appropriate to say “Go to page 5”. Although these text alternatives would not be identical, they would be consistent, and therefore would satisfy this Success Criterion.
                Note 2: A single non-text-content-item may be used to serve different functions. In such cases, different text alternatives are necessary and should be used. Examples can be commonly found with the use of icons such as check marks, cross marks, and traffic signs. Their functions can be different depending on the context of the Web page. A check mark icon may function as “approved”, “completed”, or “included”, to name a few, depending on the situation. Using “check mark” as text alternative across all Web pages does not help users understand the function of the icon. Different text alternatives can be used when the same non-text content serves multiple functions.
            Failures
                F31: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.4 due to using two different labels for the same function on different Web pages within a set of Web pages.
        3.2.5 Change on Request - Level AAA
            Changes of context are initiated only by user request or a mechanism is available to turn off such changes.
            Understanding 3.2.5
            Sufficient Techniques
            Note: Other techniques may also be sufficient if they meet the success criterion. See Understanding Techniques.
            Situation A: If the Web page allows automatic updates:
                G76: Providing a mechanism to request an update of the content instead of updating automatically
            Situation B: If automatic redirects are possible:
                SVR1: Implementing automatic redirects on the server side instead of on the client side
                G110: Using an instant client-side redirect
                    H76: Using meta refresh to create an instant client-side redirect
            Situation C: If the Web page uses pop-up windows:
                Including pop-up windows using one of the following techniques:
                    H83: Using the target attribute to open a new window on user request and indicating this in link text
                    SCR24: Using progressive enhancement to open new windows on user request.
            Situation D: If using an onchange event on a select element:
                    SCR19: Using an onchange event on a select element without causing a change of context
            Advisory Techniques
                G200: Opening new windows and tabs from a link only when necessary
            Failures
                F60: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to launching a new window when a user enters text into an input field
                F61: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to complete change of main content through an automatic update that the user cannot disable from within the content
                F9: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to changing the context when the user removes focus from a form element
                F22: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to opening windows that are not requested by the user
                F52: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.1 and 3.2.5 due to opening a new window as soon as a new page is loaded
                F41: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.1, 2.2.4, and 3.2.5 due to using meta refresh to reload the page
