Topic 6 - Accessibility, Readability & Testing

Overview
6.1 Construct well-formed HTML and CSS markup that conforms to industry
    best practices: 
        Reusing rules and rule sets, commenting, web-safe fonts,
        cross-platform usability, separation of structure (HTML) and
        style (CSS). 

6.2 Apply accessibility principles and evaluate content accessibility:
        Text alternatives, color contrast and usage, legibility of
        typography, tab order, text resizing, text hierarchy, translate. 

6.3 Evaluate the structural integrity of HTML and CSS markup:
        Syntax errors, tag mismatch, cascading issues.

WCAG 2.1 Overview
How to Meet WCAG 2.1 (Quick Reference)

Principle 1 - Perceivable:
    Guideline 1.1 - Text Alternatives
        Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it
        can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print,
        braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.
            1.1.1 Non-text Content - Level A
                All non-text content that is presented to the user has a
                text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose,
                except for the situations listed below:
                    Controls, Input: If non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes its purpose. (Refer to Success Criterion 4.1.2 for additional requirements for controls and content that accepts user input.)
                    Time-Based Media: If non-text content is time-based media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.)
                    Test: If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in text, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
                    Sensory: If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the non-text content.
                    CAPTCHA: If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities.
                    Decoration, Formatting, Invisible: If non-text content is pure decoration, is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology.

        1.4.12 Text Spacing - Level AA (Added in 2.1)
            In content implemented using markup languages that support the following text style properties, no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property:
                Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;
                Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;
                Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;
                Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.
            Exception: Human languages and scripts that do not make use of one or more of these text style properties in written text can conform using only the properties that exist for that combination of language and script.

        1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus - Level AA (Added in 2.1)
            Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:
                Dismissible: A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content;
                Hoverable: If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;
                Persistent: The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.
                Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.
