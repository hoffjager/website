    best practices: 
        Reusing rules and rule sets, commenting, web-safe fonts,
        cross-platform usability, separation of structure (HTML) and
        style (CSS). 

6.2 Apply accessibility principles and evaluate content accessibility:
        Text alternatives, color contrast and usage, legibility of
        typography, tab order, text resizing, text hierarchy, translate.

WCAG 2.1 Overview
How to Meet WCAG 2.1 (Quick Reference)

Principle 2 - Operable:
    Guideline 2.1 - Keyboard Accessible
       Make all functionality available from a keyboard.
       2.1.1 Keyboard - Level A
         All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.
         Note 1: This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not.
         Note 2: This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.
       Understanding 2.1.1
       Sufficient Techniques
       Note: Other techniques may also be sufficient if they meet the success criterion. See Understanding Techniques.

                FLASH14: Using redundant keyboard and mouse event handlers in Flash 
        Advisory Techniques
           SCR29: Adding keyboard-accessible actions to static HTML elements 
        Failures
            F54: Failure of Success Criterion 2.1.1 due to using only pointing-device-specific event handlers (including gesture) for a function
            F55: Failure of Success Criteria 2.1.1, 2.4.7, and 3.2.1 due to using script to remove focus when focus is received
            F42: Failure of Success Criteria 1.3.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.3, or 4.1.2 when emulating links 
      2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap - Level A
          If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving focus away.
          Note 1: Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference.
          Understanding 2.1.2
          Sufficient Techniques
          Note: Other techniques may also be sufficient if they meet the success criterion. See Understanding Techniques.
            G21: Ensuring that users are not trapped in content
            FLASH17: Providing keyboard access to a Flash object and avoiding a keyboard trap 
          Failures
            F10: Failure of Success Criterion 2.1.2 and Conformance Requirement 5 due to combining multiple content formats in a way that traps users inside one format type.
      2.1.3 Keyboard (No Exception) - Level AAA
         All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes.
         Understanding 2.1.3
      2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts - Level A
         If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true:
            Turn off: A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off;
            Remap: A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to include one or more non-printable keyboard keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt);
            Active only on focus: The keyboard shortcut for a user interface component is only active when that component has focus.
         Understanding 2.1.4
         Sufficient Techniques
         Note: Other techniques may also be sufficient if they meet the success criterion. See Understanding Techniques.
            Users have a way to turn off single-key shortcuts.
            A mechanism is provided to allow users to change character-key shortcuts. The remapping mechanism includes non-printing characters. The alternative shortcuts could be longer strings of up to 25 characters that would directly serve as native speech commands for any speech engine.
         Failures
            Failure of Success Criteria 2.1.4 due to a webpage or web app that includes single-key shortcuts not including a control that allows users to turn the shortcuts off or a control that allows users to change the shortcuts to key combinations that include keys that are not upper or lower-case letters, punctuation, number, or symbol characters.
    Guideline 2.2 - Enough Time
       Provide users enough time to read and use content.
       2.2.1 Timing Adjustable - Level A
        For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true:
            Turn off: The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it; or
            Adjust: The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
            Extend: The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or
            Real-time Exception: The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or
            Essential Exception: The time limit is essential and extending it would invalidate the activity; or
            20 Hour Exception: The time limit is longer than 20 hours.
        Understanding 2.2.1
        Sufficient Techniques
        Note: Other techniques may also be sufficient if they meet the success criterion. See Understanding Techniques.

                F58: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.1 due to using server-side techniques to automatically redirect pages after a time-out 
        2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide - Level A
            For moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the following are true:
                Moving, blinking, scrolling: For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is essential; and
                Auto-updating: For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.
            Note 1: For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to Guideline 2.3.
            Note 2: Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference.
            Note 3: Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.
            Note 4: An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.
