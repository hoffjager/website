<!--
1. Launch your favorite plain text editor, then start a new document with the HTML5 document type declaration.
HTML documents should not be created in word processors, such as Microsoft Word, as they include additional
information in their file formats.
2. Below the document type declaration, add a root element that defines the document’s primary language as English.
3. Within the root element, insert a document head section.
4. Within the head section, insert an element defining the document’s encoding character set.
5. Next, within the head section, insert an element defining the document’s title.
6. After the head section, insert a document body section.
7. Within the body section, insert a size-one large heading.
8. Save the document as “hello.html”, setting the encoding to the popular “UTF-8” format.
9. Now, open the HTML5 document in a modern web browser to see the title displayed on the title bar or tab, and the
document content displayed as a large heading.
