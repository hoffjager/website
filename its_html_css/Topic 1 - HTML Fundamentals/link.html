<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections.
3. Within the head section, insert elements to specify a base “resources”
directory and an icon resource:
    <base href=“http://localhost/resources/”>
    <link rel=“icon” href=“cubes.ico”>
4. Save the HTML document, then open an icon editor, such as IcoFX, and
create an icon sized 16x16 pixels.
5. Now, save the icon in the “resources” directory, named as “cubes.ico”,
and also save a copy in the root directory, named precisely as
“favicon.ico” – for Internet Explorer.
6. Open the HTML document in your web browser via a web server to see the
icon resource appear in the address field.
At the time of writing, this example is supported in all web browsers
except Microsoft Edge.
This page is served to the browser by a local web server using the
default “localhost” domain. Simply opening a local copy of this example in
a browser will not display the icon.
