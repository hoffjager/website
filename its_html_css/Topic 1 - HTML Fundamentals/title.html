<!--
1. Start a new HTML5 with a document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections.
3. Within the head section, insert a meta element specifying the character set and an empty title element.
4. Within the title element, insert a title including entities.
5. Save the document then open it in your web browser.
6. Start a vocal narrator to hear that the title may be read out as “Less-than-HTML5-in-easy-steps-greater-than”.
The vocal narrator on Windows 10 ignores angled brackets in a title, but they are read literally by the narrator in
earlier versions of Windows.
7. Edit the document title to make it more user-friendly.
8. Save the document once more, then open it in your web browser to hear the narrator now read the document title
as “HTML5 in easy steps”
