<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections.
3. Within the body section, insert a document heading.
4. Ensure that the font in your text editor is set to a fixed width font, such as
Lucida Console for Notepad.
5. Next, in the body section, insert a <pre> element containing preformatted
content in a fixed width font – and produced without any tab characters.
6. Save the HTML document, then open it in your web browser to ensure the
content retains preformatting.
Notice that <pre> is a flow element so it does not need to be enclosed within a
paragraph – it creates its own block.
You can use any character within a fixed width font to create your Text-Art –
Windows users can use the Character Map program in System Tools to select
special characters from the Lucida Console font.
