1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections, with a link element
pointing to a style sheet.
3. Within the body section, insert a paragraph containing a hyperlink with a
nested image of a specific size.
4. Save the HTML document, then open the web page in your browser and follow
the hyperlink.
The dimensions of this button are exaggerated for illustration purposes – web page
buttons are typically smaller.
Browsers usually add a border around an image when it is nested within a hyperlink
to indicate that it is not merely an illustration. Style rules can remove the
image border and can also swap the image when the cursor is placed over it to
perform a “rollover”. There are several ways to achieve this effect – the
technique described below hides the image when the cursor is placed over it, to
reveal the background image on the container element behind.
