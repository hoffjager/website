<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections.
3. Add the following code to the body section's opening tag:
<body onload = ”alert(‘Greetings!’)”>
    <noscript>JavaScript Is Not Enabled!</noscript>
    <h1>Page Loaded</h1>
4. Save the HTML document, then open it in your web browser to see the alert
dialog appear when it loads.
5. Close the alert dialog, then disable JavaScript support and reload the page
to see the advisory message.
The alert dialog is “modal” – the user must click OK to close it before the page
will completely load.
With the Firefox web browser, shown here, enter about:config in its address bar,
then accept the “risk” warning and click the javascript:enabled item to false –
to disable JavaScript support.
