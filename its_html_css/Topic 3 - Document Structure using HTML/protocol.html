<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing a head section, incorporating a style sheet and
script, and a body section.
3. Within the body section, insert an image and a paragraph containing two
hyperlinks that target different protocols.

4. Save the HTML document, then create a style sheet with a rule to hide the
image and a rule to style the paragraph:
Refer to:
protocol.css

5. Save the style sheet, then create a script to alternately reveal and hide the
image when the first hyperlink gets activated:
Refer to:
protocol.js

6. Save the script, then open the web page in your browser and click on the first
link to reveal the image element.
7. Click on the first hyperlink to hide the image element again, then click on the
second hyperlink to launch your default client email application – ready to send
a message.
This script first examines the current visibility status of the image element,
then reverses it.
The mailto: protocol automatically adds the email address of the recipient in the
“To” field of the email client.
