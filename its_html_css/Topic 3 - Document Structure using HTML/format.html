7. Finally, insert a paragraph that has been added, which contains a text snippet
that has been changed.
8. Save the HTML document, then open it in your web browser to see how the text
has been formatted.
The <big> and <tt> tags in the previous version of HTML are now obsolete, as they
were seen as presentational.
The <small> tag does not denote content of lesser importance, only that it is a
side comment to surrounding text.
