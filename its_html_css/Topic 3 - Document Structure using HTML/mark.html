<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections.
3. Within the body section, add a paragraph that marks a word-break opportunity.
4. Next, within the body section, add a paragraph that marks a superseded price
and provides a current price.
5. Now, within the body section, add paragraphs that mark text for reference and
mark a misspelled word.
6. Save the HTML document then open it in your web browser to see how the text
has been marked.
Suggesting word-break opportunities with <wbr> is particularly suitable for small
devices, but implementation is dependent upon support for this feature in the
browser.
