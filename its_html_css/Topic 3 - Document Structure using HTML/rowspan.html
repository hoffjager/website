<!--
1. Make a copy of table.html, and rename it “rowspan.html”
2. Change the document and table titles.
3. In the table data element containing the text “Cell 1.1”, insert an attribute
in its opening tag and edit its content.
4. Now, delete the table data element containing the text “Cell 2.1” – as this
cell is now spanned.
5. Save the HTML document, then open the rowspan.css style sheet and add
rules to style cells spanning rows.
Refer to:
    rowspan.css

6. Reopen the HTML document, then insert an attribute into the table data element
containing the text “Cell 2.2” and edit its content.
7. Now, delete the table data element containing the text “Cell 3.2” – as this
cell is now spanned.
8. Save the amended HTML document, then open it in your browser to see the cell
spanning two rows in Column 2.
9. Reopen the HTML document once more, then insert an attribute into the table
data element containing the text “Cell 1.3” and edit its content:
10. Now, delete the table data elements containing the text “Cell 2.3” and
“Cell 3.3” – as these cells are now spanned.
11. Save the amended HTML document, then open it in your browser to see the cell
spanning three rows in Column 3.
Insert tab spaces between all table data elements in the HTML code to align them
so it’s easier to configure the table layout.
Notice that by default, text in each cell is left-aligned and horizontally
centered in merged cells.
