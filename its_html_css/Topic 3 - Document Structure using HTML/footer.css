Refer back to:
footer.html
1. Create a style sheet to control the position of the page footer contents.
2. Save the HTML document and the style sheet, then open the web page in your
browser to see how the footers appear.
<section> elements are not required in short documents like this one – unless you
particularly want to add section headings and footers.
