<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections, with a link element
pointing to a style sheet.
3. Within the body section, insert two hyperlinks that designate different
numeric access key characters.
4. Save the HTML document, then create a similar second document containing the
same two hyperlinks.
Refer to:
catalog.html
5. Save the second HTML document, then create a style sheet to remove the default
hyperlink styles and to highlight each hyperlink when they receive focus.
Refer to:
access.css
6. Now, save the style sheet, then open the first web page in your browser to see
the hyperlinks without default styles.
7. Hit the Tab key repeatedly until the second hyperlink receives focus, then hit
Return to follow that link.
8. Press the appropriate access key combination for your browser and number 1 key,
such as ALT + 1, then hit Return to follow the first hyperlink.
Removing the default hyperlink styles means they are no longer easily recognizable
as links – so it is best avoided unless some other indication makes the user aware
they can be used for navigation purposes.
