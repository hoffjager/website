<!--
1. Start a new HTML5 document.
2. In the body section, insert a form element containing a submit button to send
form data by the GET method.
3. Now, in the form element, insert a paragraph containing a checkbox to appear
automatically checked.
The <fieldset> element only groups the related elements it encloses for visual
presentation – it does not associate them programmatically.
4. Next, in the form element, insert a fieldset containing a legend and five
checkboxes to appear unchecked.
5. Save the HTML document, then open the web page in your browser, check some
boxes, and submit the form.
Notice that the checked attribute need have no assigned value – its mere presence
sets the switch to “on”, and its absence leaves the switch in its default “off”
state.
As the checkboxes for the Walking and Jogging activities are unchecked, their
name=value pairs are not sent to the server.
