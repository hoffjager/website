<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections.
3. Within the body section, insert a main document heading.
4. Next, within the body section, insert a section heading.
5. Now, within the body section, insert some article headings followed by
paragraphs containing the article content.
6. Finally, add another section with two more articles.
7. Save the HTML document, then open it in your web browser to see the headings
and document structure.
Never use heading elements for their font properties as these can be overridden by
style sheet rules – always consider headings to represent structure.
All screenshots throughout this chapter have added (unlisted) colored border
styles to more clearly illustrate the page area occupied by the elements
described.
The document structure created by the sequenced headings is known as the document
“outline”. Properly constructed outlines allow a part of the page, such as a
single article, to be easily syndicated into another site. The outline for the
document above is illustrated alongside.
