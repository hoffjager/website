<!--
1. Start a new HTML5 document.
2. In the body section, insert a form element containing a submit button to send
form data by the POST method and specify the encoding type for Form Data.
3. In the form element, insert a file element and a line break.
4. Save the HTML document, then open the web page in your browser, select a file
and submit the form.
5. Examine the headers to see the file details as Form Data.
To process this example, the files upload.pl and upload.css need to be added to
the “htdocs” directory of a local running web server – these are located in the
download archive for this book available from:
