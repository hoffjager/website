<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections, with two script elements
and a link to a style sheet.
3. Within the body section, insert a table that provides a template for its data
row.
Refer to:
data.js
4. Save the HTML document, then create a script that defines an associative array
of data keys and values.
5. Save the data script, then create a functional script to write the data values
into the template row.
Refer to:
template.js
6. Save the functional script, then create a style sheet with rules to specify the
appearance of the table, and apply background color to alternate rows.
Refer to:
template.css
7. Save the style sheet, then open the HTML document in your web browser to see
the table dynamically created.
By default, the table’s header row will also receive the alternating background
color unless a rule specifies a background color for each <th> element.
