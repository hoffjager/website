<!--
1. Start a new HTML5 document that incorporates a script.
2. In the body section, insert a form element containing a text input field, which
both have an identity for scripting.
3. Next, in the form element, insert an image button that will simply submit the
form.
4. Now, in the form element, insert an image button that will perform validation
then submit the form.
Note that the image button that will perform validation is given an identity so
script can attach a behavior to it.
Refer to:
ibutton.js
5. Create a script that designates a function when the page gets loaded – to
attach a behavior to an image button.
6. Save the HTML document and script, then open the web page in your browser,
enter an incomplete email address and submit the form using each button.
7. When validation fails using the button with scripted behavior, complete the
email address correctly then use the validating button again to submit the form
successfully.
The script in this example checks the input text against a regular expression
pattern that describes the format of any valid email address. The pattern must
appear on a single line – exactly as it is listed here.
