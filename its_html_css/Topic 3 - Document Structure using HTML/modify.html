<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections.
3. Within the body section, insert a paragraph containing superscript produced by
character entities.
4. Now, in the body section, insert a similar paragraph containing superscript
produced by HTML elements.
5. Finally, in the body section, insert a paragraph containing subscript produced
by HTML elements.
6. Save the document, then open it in your browser to compare the superscript and
to see the subscript text.
When using superscript ² in paragraphs to denote area, such as 10 feet², you may
prefer to use the entity &sup2; rather than <sup>2</sup> to keep line spacings
equal.
