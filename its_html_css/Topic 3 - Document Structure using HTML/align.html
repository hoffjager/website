<!--
1. Make a copy of the table.html document, created here, and rename it “align.html”
2. Change the document and table titles.
3. Now, edit each table row element to assign class names for styling content
alignment.
Refer to:
align.css
4. Save the HTML document, then reopen the align.css style sheet and add
rules to style cell content alignment, cell height, and background color.
5. Save the style sheet, then open the web page in your browser to compare the
cell content alignment on each row.
Table cells are automatically spaced apart at a fixed distance by default, but the
cell spacing can be removed by a style rule specifying a collapse value to the
table’s border-collapse property. The outer table border can be explicitly
suppressed by a style rule specifying a none value to the table’s border property,
and individual cell borders can be removed by a style rule specifying a value of
zero to the cell’s border property.
Notice that the final row aligns content to the bottom of each cell in both <th>
and <td> elements, as they inherit the rule applied to that row’s <tr> element.
6. Edit the align.html document to assign class names for styling the table
element and the top left empty table cell.
7. Reopen the align.css style sheet again and add rules to remove the table
and top left cell borders, and cell spacing.
8. Save the HTML document and style sheet once more, then reopen the web page
to see the borders removed.
Cell and table borders can be removed or styled individually using their
border-top, border-right, border-bottom, and border-left properties.
It is particularly useful to remove the top left empty cell in tables without
borders.
