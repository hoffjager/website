<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections, with a link element
pointing to a style sheet.
3. Within the body section, insert a hyperlink to a target page, including tooltip
advice.
4. Save the HTML document, then create a similar second document containing a
link targeting the first document.
Refer to:
target.html
5. Save the second HTML document, then create a style sheet to emphasize each
hyperlink state.
Refer to:
hyperlink.css
6. Save the style sheet, then open the first web page in your browser to see the
hyperlink in its default state.
7. Place the cursor over the hyperlink to see its hover state, then hold down the
left mouse button to see the hyperlink’s active state.
8. Now, release the mouse button to load the linked target resource, then click
its hyperlink to reload the first document and see that hyperlink’s visited state.
The hyperlink on the target page instantly appears in the visited state because
the browser recognizes that its return target has been previously visited.
