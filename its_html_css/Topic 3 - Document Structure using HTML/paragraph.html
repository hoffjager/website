    <h1>The Statue of Liberty</h1>
    <p>
        The Statue of Liberty was built over nine years by French sculptor, Auguste
        Bartholdi.<br /> Upon its completion in 1884, all 350 individual pieces of the statue
        were packed into<br /> 214 crates for the long boat ride from France to New York.

    <p>
        The statue arrived in America several months later and was reconstructed on
        Liberty Island.<br /> Auguste Bartholdi thought that the New York harbor was the perfect
        setting for his masterpiece,<br /> because it was where immigrants got their first view
        of the New World.
