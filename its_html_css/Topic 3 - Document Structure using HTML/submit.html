<!--
1. Start a new HTML5 document.
2. In the body section, insert an element to submit form data to a server-side
script using the GET method.
3. Now, in the form element, insert a paragraph containing a submission button –
whose value will appear on the button.
4. Save the HTML document, then open the web page your browser and click the
button to submit the data in assigned to its name=value pair, and to see the
response.
To process the examples in this chapter, the files echo.pl, echo.css, perl.png and
abyss.png should be placed in the “htdocs” directory of a local running web server
– these are located in the download archive for this book available from
ineasysteps.com/resource-centre/downloads
Notice the data appended in the browser’s address field by the GET method – you
can submit via the POST method to prevent this for sensitive data.
