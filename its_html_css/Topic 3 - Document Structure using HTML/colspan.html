<!--
1. Make a copy of table.html, and rename it colspan.html
2. Change the document and table titles.
3. In the table data element containing the text “Cell 1.1”, insert an attribute
in its opening tag and edit its content.
4. Now, delete the table data element containing the text “Cell 1.2” – as this
cell is now spanned.
Refer to:
colspan.css
5. Save the HTML document, then re-open the colspan.css style sheet and add
rules to style cells spanning columns.
6. Save the style sheet, then open the web page in your browser to see the cell
spanning two columns on Row 1.
7. Reopen the HTML document, then insert an attribute into the table data element
containing the text “Cell 2.1”:
<td colspan=”3”>Cell 2.1+2.2+2.3</td>
8. Now, delete the table data elements containing the text “Cell 2.2” and
“Cell 2.3” – as these cells are now spanned.
9. Save the amended HTML document, then open it in your browser to see the cell
spanning three columns on Row 2.
10. Reopen the HTML document once more, then insert another attribute into the
table data element containing the text “Cell 2.1+2.2+2.3” and edit its content:
<td colspan=”3” rowspan=”2”>Cell 2.1+2.2+2.3+3.1+3.2+3.3</td>
11. Now, delete the table data elements containing the text “Cell 3.1”, “Cell 3.2”
and “Cell 3.3” – cells now spanned.
12. Save the amended HTML document, then open it in your browser to see the cell
span three columns and two rows.
Combined spans are rectangular – they cannot span an L-shape.
Column spanning and row spanning can be combined to create large rectangular
blocks of cells extending over multiple columns and across multiple rows
