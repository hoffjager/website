<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections.
3. Within the body section, add a paragraph that emphasizes some text without
affecting the meaning of the sentence.
4. Next, within the body section, add paragraphs that emphasize some text to
affect the meaning of the sentence.
5. Save the HTML document, then open it in your web browser to see how the text
has been emphasized.
The <b> tag should be avoided wherever possible, but one legitimate use is to
markup the lead sentence of an article.
Refer to:
    emphasis.css
