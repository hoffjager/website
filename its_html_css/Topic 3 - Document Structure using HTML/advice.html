<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections.
3. In the body section, insert a paragraph containing an abbreviation with
tooltip advice.
4. Next, insert a citation reference with tooltip advice.
5. Now, insert a definitive term with tooltip advice.
6. Then, insert a keyboard instruction with tooltip advice.
7. Finally, add an element in the head section to identify a script that will
respond to the keyboard instruction.
Refer to:
advice.js
8. Save the HTML document, then exactly copy the script below and save it as
“advice.js” alongside the HTML file.
9. Open the HTML document and place the cursor over the elements to see the
individual tooltips.
10. With JavaScript support enabled in your browser, press the Y key to see the
script response.
Remember to use single quote marks for nested quotes – as with ‘HTML’ in Step 5.
The script looks at the keycode when the key gets pressed and will respond to
lowercase “y” and uppercase “Y”.
