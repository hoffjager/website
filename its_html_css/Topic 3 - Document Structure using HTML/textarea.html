<!--
1. Start a new HTML5 document.
2. In the body section, insert a form element containing a submit button to send
form data by the POST method.
3. Now, in the form element, insert a text input area that has 8 rows and is 70
average character widths wide.
4. Save the HTML document, then open the web page in your browser, enter some
data and submit the form.
5. The text is not appended to the URL, so examine the response headers to see it
has been sent as “Form Data”.
The average character width may vary between browsers − so the physical size of
the text area field may vary too.
You can use the Developer Tools in the Google Chrome web browser to examine
response headers.
