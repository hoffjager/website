<!--
1. Start with the HTML5 document type declaration.
2. Add a root element containing head and body sections, with a link element
pointing to a style sheet.
3. Within the body section, insert two hyperlinks that contain fragment
identifiers and also target different fragments.
4. Next, in the body, insert a content paragraph followed by a hyperlink
containing a fragment identifier and targeting the first hyperlink in the
document.
5. Save the HTML document, then create a second similar document with
hyperlinks both above and below content.
Refer to:
    next.html
6. Create a style sheet that sizes and colors the content area of each document –
representing different page bodies.
Refer to:
    fragment.css
7. Save the style sheet, then open the first web page in your browser and follow
the hyperlinks to each of this document’s fragments below and above its body
content.
8. Now, follow the hyperlink to the fragment in the second document, then return
to the top of the first document.
At the end of lengthy pages include a hyperlink to a fragment at the top of the
page so the user need not scroll back up.
