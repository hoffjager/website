        The <span class="serif">City of New York</span>
        was introduced to professional football on the same day
        that the city was introduced to the
        <span class="fantasy">New York Giants</span>.
        It was a clear sunny
        <span class="mono">October afternoon in 1925</span>
        when the Giants took the field to play against the
        <span class="cursive">Frankford Yellow Jackets</span>.
