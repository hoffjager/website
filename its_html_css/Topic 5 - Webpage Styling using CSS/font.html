    In 1934 the
    <span class="giant">New York Giants</span> beat the
    <span class="bears">Chicago Bears</span>, by
    <span class="score">30-13</span>,
    in nine-degree temperatures
    [ <span class="stadium">at the Polo Grounds</span> ]
    in a game that has become famous as the "Sneakers
    Game." With the <span class="giant">Giants</span>
    trailing <span class="score">10-3</span> at the half,
    head coach <span class="coach">Steve Owen</span>
    provided his squad with basketball shoes to increase
    traction on the icy turf. The team responded with four
    touchdowns in the second half to turn the game into a
    <span class="giant">Giants</span> rout.
