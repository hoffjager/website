        The Geologic Story at the
        <span class="spread">Grand Canyon</span>
        attracts the attention of the world for many reasons, but
        perhaps its greatest significance lies in the geologic record
        preserved and exposed here.

        The rocks at
        <span class="spread">Grand Canyon</span>
        are not inherently unique but the
        <span class="space">
            variety of rocks clearly exposed
            present a complex geologic story.
